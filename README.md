## Description
This is a simple C# console application that will take in the user input for player 1 and player 2. It will then cycle through the responses of both and pit them against each other in a BATTLE OF THE DEATH!!!! Or a friendly game of tic tac toe. Once each player finishes it will swap to the next and so on. This will last until 9 turns have been taken or a player wins. After this it will display the winner and then exit.
